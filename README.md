# 👋🏾 Hey, I’m Ariel (or Reese)!

Welcome to my world! I’ve been building in tech for 13+ years, and these days I run my own thing—helping small businesses level up their tech.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- Fullstack dev (Node, Java, C/C#/C++, Python)
- React/Typescript wizardry
- Project & product management
- Tech leadership
- Docs that don’t suck

## 💬 About Me

I’m a 34 year old Black lady from New Orleans. I’m all about breaking the “typical techie” mold. If you’ve never felt like you fit in, you’re probably in the right spot. Tech is for all of us, seriously.

## 🌱 Fun Stuff

- 📚 Reading
- 🪴 Gardening
- 🍞 Baking
- 💪🏾 Working out
- 👩🏾‍🤝‍👨🏾 Spending time with my husband and kids
